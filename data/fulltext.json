    "text": "Build automation tools automate the process of building code, including steps such as compiling, packaging binary code, and running automated tests. Because of this, build automation tools are considered a key part of a continuous delivery pipeline. Build automation tools read build scripts to define how they should perform a build. Common build scripts include Makefile, Dockerfile, and bash. Earthly is a build automation tool that allows you to execute all your builds in containers. Earthly uses Earthfiles, which draws from the best features of Makefile and Dockerfile and provides a common layer between language-specific tooling and the CI build spec. Earthly builds are repeatable, isolated, and self-contained, and will run the same way across different environments such as a CI system or a developer’s laptop."
